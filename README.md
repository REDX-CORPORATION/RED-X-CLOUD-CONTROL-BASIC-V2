## üìå About This Project

**RED-X CLOUD CONTROL BASIC V2** is the enhanced version of the original RED-X CLOUD CONTROL BASIC. Now, users don‚Äôt need to touch or send HTML files‚Äîthe EXE auto-generates and displays the local IPv4 address via a popup window. Just open that address on any device connected to the same network to control your application remotely.

Perfect for:

- ‚úÖ Beginners diving into local networking and remote control  
- ‚úÖ Fast and simple setups
- ‚úÖ Remote triggering of actions from mobile or browser‚Äîno backend needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Run the `RED-X CLOUD CONTROL BASIC V2.exe` on your Windows PC.  
2. A popup window will display your **IPv4 address** and the port number (e.g., `http://192.168.0.214:6969/redx`).  
3. On any device connected to the same Wi-Fi, open a browser and navigate to that address.  
4. The homepage presented includes buttons that send HTTP commands to your EXE.  
5. Pressing buttons triggers predefined actions within your application‚Äîlike toggling cheats, running scripts, or other supported functionality.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the EXE
Simply double-click the executable (`RED-X CLOUD CONTROL BASIC V2.exe`). A window will immediately pop up showing your local IPv4 and port‚Äîno manual IP lookup needed!

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Access from Any Device
