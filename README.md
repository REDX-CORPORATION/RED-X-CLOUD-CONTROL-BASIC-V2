## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Run the EXE** — A popup will display your IPv4 address and port.
2. **Open the link** in any browser on the same Wi-Fi/LAN network.
3. **Use the dashboard** to send commands to the host machine (predefined actions like toggles, scripts, etc.).
4. **Instant control** — No backend server or manual HTML setup needed.

> 💡 The version can be **integrated directly into your own projects**.

- ⚡ **0.5s latency** (adjustable)
- 🚫 **No separate HTML file required**
- 📱 **100% mobile-compatible** (customizable IP support)

## ⚠ Important Notes

- 🔥 **Turn off firewall** (or allow the port through) for LAN access.
- 🎨 **HTML is fully editable** to change button names/colors.
